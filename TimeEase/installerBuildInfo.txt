You will only need to install IzPack and then extract the contents of the installerBuild.zip.  Change the paths in the buildInstallers.sh to
the relative paths on your system. You will also need to change the dir attribute of the fileset tag in the installer.xml's. Once that is 
done you can just run the .sh and all the needed files will be built.
