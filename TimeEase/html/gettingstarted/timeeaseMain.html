Time Ease was developed for widespread use, and is in the early stages of feature implementations.  I will be adding new features often, so check for upcoming updates.
Currently we offer integration with FreshBooks, however working on the ability to use Time Ease as a stand alone Time Tracker is in the works. Currently we support these 
features:
<br/><br/>
<b>1.</b> Track time on FreshBooks Clients, Projects, and Tasks.<br/>
<b>2.</b> Manual time entry creation.<br/>
<b>3.</b> Update entries already put into FreshBooks, currently shows 7 days worth of working time.<br/>
<b>4.</b> Clock In/Out support for those who don't need a counter. Simply Clock In, then Out.<br/>
<b>5.</b> Offline support, after initial FreshBooks Sync.<br/>
<b>6.</b> Single instance supports multiple users.<br/>
<b>7.</b> Define system preferences and defaults, such as Default Client, Project, and Tasks.<br/>
<b>8.</b> Work completely offline, after initial FreshBooks Sync.<br/>
<b>9.</b> FreshBooks Sync, ensure your always up to date.<br/>
<b>10.</b> Report a bug or request a new feature from the Time Ease user interface.<br/>
<b>11.</b> Support for automatic updates, or manage update yourself by simply clicking 'Check for Updates' whenever your ready.<br/>
<b>12.</b> Contains Help documentation, as you can see, to help answer your Time Ease questions.<br/>
<b>13.</b> System Tray support, perform some functions without the application window open.<br/>

<br/><br/>

<b>To enable Automatic Updates</b><br/>
<b>1.</b> Go to 'Time Ease' and select 'Preferences'.<br/> 
<b>2.</b> Expand 'Install/Update' --> then select 'Automatic Updates'.<br/>
<b>3.</b> Select 'Automatically find new updates and notify me.'<br/>
<b>4.</b> Now select 'OK'.<br/>
<b>5.</b> Now every time Time Ease starts it will look for updates, it will allow you to say if to install it or not.<br/>
