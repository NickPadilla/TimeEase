<h1>Adding Time Entries</h1>
I have attempted to make adding time as easy as possible. Time Ease supports being offline and we will store any entry that gets created or updated during time offline.
You will need to select Sync when back online to Sync the Time Ease state with FreshBooks. This Sync operation will happen when you first start up the application
if you are online, otherwise waits for a manual Sync while online. Here are the Time Entry options:
<br/><br/>
<b>1. Tracking Time.</b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	a. Select 'Track Time' --> 'Track Time', or select this icon from the Tool Bar: <img src="time_go.png"/>.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	b. This will open a new editor.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	c. The application will pull your default Clients, Projects, and Tasks; if you have set them up.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	i. If there isn't a default setup you will need to select a Client.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	ii. Now that you have selected the Client the Projects will now show, select one.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	iii. Again your Task selections will update when the Project is selected, please select a Task.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	g. Press Start to begin the timer, Stop to pause the time, or Reset to clear all selections and the timer.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	h. Press Send/Store when you are ready to send the transaction to FreshBooks.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	i. You must have a Client, Project, and Task selected to send your entry.<br/>
<br/><br/>
<b>2. Clocking In and Out.</b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	a. Select this icon from the Tool Bar: <img src="clock_play.png"/>, or select the Go-Time icon from the System Tray, right click and select 'Clock In'.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	b. This will register the start time.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	c. When ready to Clock Out select this icon from the <img src="clock_stop.png"/>. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	i. A pop up will display to allow you to enter the entry details. Your Time Ease settings will be selected by default.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	ii. If there isn't a default setup you will need to select a Client.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	iii. Now that you have selected the Client the Projects will now show, select one.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	iv. Again your Task selections will update when the Project is selected, please select a Task.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	iv. You are required to have all options set, except for the Notes as they are optional.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	d. Press 'Ok' when you are ready to send the transaction to FreshBooks, or 'Cancel' to not send the entry.<br/>
<br/><br/>
<b>3. Adding Manual Entry.</b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	a. Select 'Track Time' --> 'Track Time', or select this icon from the Tool Bar: <img src="time_go.png"/>.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	b. This will open a new editor.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	c. You will be able to just add some time manually to the timer, defaults to '00:00:00'.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	i. The format is Hours:Minutes:Seconds, hh:mm:ss; ex. 01:32:01 is one hour, thirty two minutes and.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	ii. You are also able to just add 01 for a single hour, or 01:30 for an hour and a half.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	iii. Set the other entry details, add notes if you would like.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	d. Select Send/Store when you are ready to send to FreshBooks. <br/>
